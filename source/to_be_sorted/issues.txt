==> sequences with any of the keywords (dead, recycled, allocated, allocating) should not have an author
==> an allocated sequence should have only %I, %S, %N, and %K lines.
==> sequences for which all terms are in {-1, 0, 1} should have only the first offset number.
==> sequences for which the first term with absolute value greater than 1 is not displayed only have a second offset if it is manually entered (but some have not been).

==> Concerning P14: There is nothing wrong here. Please modify your rules to allow these formats.

If there are any more combinations of keywords that should trigger warnings I'd like to know. I currently have:

==> "full" without "fini"      --> warning (never occurs).
==> "tabl" and "tabf" together --> warning (occurred 1 time, fixed now).

==> https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Charles_R_Greathouse_IV/Keywords is the closest thing we have to an authoritative reference on keywords
==> https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Charles_R_Greathouse_IV/Format   is the closest thing we have to an authoritative reference on the b-file

==> Keywords "recycled", "allocated", and "allocating" should never appear with other keywords.
==> keyword:dead should also appear alone, but in practice there are cases where it does not (I count 54).
==> kw:nice should never appear with kw:less.
==> kw:easy should never appear with kw:hard.
==> kw:nonn should never appear with kw:sign.
==> keywords done, dupe, huge, and part have been deprecated and should not be used in any sequences.

==> "nice" should also never appear with "obsc".

2015-09-17, 18:25 (CG)

==> Forbidden combination: full and more
==> I've added this, and the others, to https://oeis.org/wiki/User:Charles_R_Greathouse_IV/Keywords

2015-09-17, 18:25 (CG)

==> Forbidden combination, though: full and more.

2015-09-17, 19:03 (Frank Adams-Waters)

==> I tend to think that "nice" and "core" really are incompatible with "obsc" and "uned".

2015-09-17, 19:46 (NS)

==> There is also nothing wrong with the combination less+more

I believe all the problems you identified that involved b-files (P5, P6, P7, P8, P12) have been addressed for the sequences you listed in your initial problem report.
If you can provide details for other similar problems, I'd be happy to work on them as time permits.


Negative values do occur, so keyword should be 'sign' rather than 'nonn'.
